# ActionRoguelike
Stanford CS193U Reference Project (Fall '20)
Continuing Tom Looman's C++ Unreal Tutorial.

-New to github I made the mistake of making multiple repositories, treating them like test backups, a habit I got from video editing. 

-I got rid of several of the extra repositories, probably ridding of the the track history. 
I think I'm going to keep the project labelled Looman or ActionRoguelike because they have track history. 

-I need to do a udemy course and commit a few hours to full understanding gitHub. I'm paranoid about overwriting work hence why I liked creating back ups via local directories and just uploading them into a simple cloud directory, as opposed to githubs system.
